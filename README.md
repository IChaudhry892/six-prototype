# SIX Prototype

SIX is a Roku-inspired streaming platform concept, designed and planned by our software engineering group as if we were a startup company. While the original project focused on design, architecture, and planning, this repository contains a **non-functional prototype** built for extra credit. The prototype demonstrates the user interface and flow of the SIX platform using HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript.

## Features

- **Home Screen**: Browse apps and continue watching content.
- **Subscription Management**: View available streaming services and manage subscriptions.
- **Search**: On-screen keyboard for searching content.
- **Settings**: Network, software update, and diagnostic report options.
- **Account Registration & Verification**: Simulated registration and email verification flow.
- **Payment Flow**: Simulated payment and approval screens.
- **Streaming Video Page**: Placeholder for video playback.

## Structure

- HTML files for each screen (e.g., `home.html`, `subscription.html`, `settings.html`, etc.)
- Shared styles in [`styles/general.css`](styles/general.css)
- App and thumbnail images in [`app-icons/`](app-icons/) and [`thumbnails/`](thumbnails/)
- Minimal JavaScript for UI interactions (e.g., search keyboard, update/diagnostic animations)

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open [`index.html`](index.html) in your browser.
3. Navigate through the prototype using the provided links and buttons.

> **Note:** This is a static, non-functional prototype. No backend, authentication, or real streaming is implemented.
